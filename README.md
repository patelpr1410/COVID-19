Detection of Covid-19 Virus cases 

The number of people infected with COVID-19 has risen rapidly. Machine vision techniques and artificial intelligence are critical in diagnosing and treating disease. The purpose of this paper was to propose a method for the “COVID-19” problem via a set of lung images that included three categories of pneumonia, COVID-19, and healthy. A deep convolutional neural network consisting of 11 layers was applied to extract the features. The binary differential metaheuristic method was used to select relevant features and eliminate unrelated features. Lung X-ray images were classified using an SVM classifier based on these optimal features. This study demonstrated that the accuracy indicator and the number of relevant extracted features outperformed previous methods using the same data. Based on a deep neural network and a metaheuristic feature selection algorithm, the proposed model can be used in various other medical applications.
